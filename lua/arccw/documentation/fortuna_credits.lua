--- Basicall Dev Log ---

Sanity Check List:
[Weapons]
Exotic/Hybrid/Makeshift Weapons (6/8)
BioMechanic Weapons (0/2)
THE FUCKING MUZZLE POSTIION (0)
LASER FOR NORMAL WEAPONS (0)
SHOTGUN AND SNIPER AMMO TYPE (0)


ExHybird is: not so m4 and ak, design stolen from IW and TF2, mostly bullpup cuz for some reason you see alot of bullpup and p90 in sci-fi
BioEngineered is the grand daddy of them all, the mentioned above have one thing in common: Symmetry 
this does not
it is a true test of asymmetry, volume, perpsective, depth, concepting and execution
and stuff like sculpting and retopo to fit the lowpoly style
hopefully i can Do atleast one of them


[Theme]
(exotic)
victorian steam punk 
<1890 west america 
obscure early cold war era (hopefully from africa cuz i have never seen a game set in cold war africa)
(hybrid/makeshift)
1944-45 last ditch weapon
early ww2 french resistance weapon

at least one original design*

Weapon Design:
[IMR] - bullpup based on late cold war russian prototype with boxy NATO look
[SeRv-45] - based on a not glock in a not airsoft roni frame
[DB-10] - marlin + spas 12 hybrid, Load like a winchester cuz the m1887 style loading gate is too hard for my brain to handle 
[FX-92] - just a fucking oicw, f2000 + xm8??? hybrid thing

ofc all of these will have their sci-fi momento 
to cover my lack of gun experience, which i think its a fucking waste of Time, i just want to make cool looking stuff, no one fucking cares about the lack of gas block or something,
fuck are you gonna use gun knowledge for? killing people? anyways tangent
its a mix between old and new so i can just say "its not a fucking real gun" to all those gun cunts that wont shut up

* nothing is original, im saying that i want to make a thing that doesnt borrow the design of stuff like m4s and aks from stratch with no ref
i dont plan to be a gun 3d artist and never will but some knowledge on specific modelling technique use on symmetrical design would help me greatly on the road to pure asymmetrical bionic design



the focus of FS2R was how much shit can i add to an existing gun before burnout
the focus of Tuna is how much shit can i design/make before boredom 
therefore, individual customisation like fas2 -as much as i want- is not and will not be a priority
im tired of stealing, this is my attempt to create something all by me
as long as you dont count concept art and sounds 

this project is a direct fuck you to all the gun cunts out there
to show that m4s and aks (and guns in general)* are boring pieces of trash that should never exist
and how people are wrong to bash an art form that derives too much from the little cozy familiarity of genericallity (is that a word? fuck is a noun of generic???)
i wish games would stop including generic shit like m4s and aks 
i fucking hate how every bloody game no matter how far to the future or past MUST have a fucking ak




why Do i have all these dev blog for big projects? self reflection
to see how far i has changed in both my goal and my philosophy over the course of a project 

and looking back, i see i was trully a retard
but at least my scopes are feasible
