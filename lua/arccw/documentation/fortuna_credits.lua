the focus of FS2R was how much shit can i add to an existing gun before burnout
the focus of Tuna is how much shit can i design/make before boredom 
therefore, individual customisation like fas2 -as much as i want- is not and will not be a thing
im tired of stealing, this is my attempt to create something all by me
as long as you dont count concept art and sounds 

this project is a direct fuck you to all the gun cunts out there
to show that m4s and aks (and guns in general)* are boring pieces of trash that should never exist
and how people are wrong to bash an art form that derives too much from the little cozy familiarity of genericallity (is that a word? fuck is a noun of generic???)
i wish games would stop including generic shit like m4s and aks 
i fucking hate how every bloody game no matter how far to the future or past MUST have a fucking ak
kinda broke my own philosophy with the awxr6 but oh well it is based on an arx, which is just an italian m4 :/




why Do i have all these dev blog for big projects? self reflection
to see how far i has changed in both my goal and my philosophy over the course of a project 

and looking back, i see i was truly a retard
but at least my scopes are feasible
