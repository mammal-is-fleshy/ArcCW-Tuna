Design, Role Explain Thing: (chrononical order)
FX-92: f2000 + (xm8/g36), i want a bulky ar to fit "late game" tier slow firing kinda battle rifle bullshit, 40 round cuz fuck you
		but had to nerf it so it wouldnt just beat every other thing so the reload is even longer than a belt fed, might nerfed it too hard, idk
AWRX-6: (m590/mass26) + (arx/scar/zh06), "mid game" tier weapon, basically your bitch boy generic assault rifle #20451112155
		underbarrel shotgun cuz im buck main deal with it		- dont call this a m4 thing, i dont even have any m4 ref for this one, xcept the irons i guess
DB-14: (spas/marlin), i want a spas, i also want a m1887, you can see the rest of my thought process
Adler-442: rsh12 + that one weird looking ass carbine revolver on google images, i want revolver for novelty but im also missing dmr role
H4WK-18: just a g3 with like 2 parts of a cetme lc, for some reason i wanted to Do a g3, and i hate myself so enjoy the anim		- fr doe theres like 0 different between a cetme and a g3 lmao, they all look the same
APX-10: apc9 + ump, original draft has xm8 parts but i had to scrap it, i want some hk vector, Close enough
VT0R-5: sten mk5 but not, i want side fed mag, i want an actual lmg belt, i want another fast firing, i want MW19 FiNN, therefore- this
RMB-17: (an94/amb16) "late game-ish" tier suppressed weapon, i dont want to Do some bitch boy mp5sd and i swore to not include an ak, and im missing actual explosive-y anti tank weapon
	   so i look at a bunch of ak derivatives and a famas, the rpg concept is from the obviously well known concept, rest is a mash of amb16, an94, that one finnish and hugarian ak, with "cool parts" from an ak12 and cz805,
Leviathan: fish but one of them cage spine thinggie like dolphin and not vertical? flat spine thinggie like trout

the focus of FS2R was how much shit can i add to an existing gun before burnout
the focus of Tuna is how much shit can i design/make before boredom 
therefore, individual customisation like fas2 -as much as i want- is not and will not be a thing
im tired of stealing, this is my attempt to create something all by me
as long as you dont count concept art and sounds 

this project is a direct fuck you to all the gun cunts out there
to show that m4s and aks (and guns in general)* are boring pieces of trash that should never exist
and how people are wrong to bash an art form that derives too much from the little cozy familiarity of genericallity (is that a word? fuck is a noun of generic???)
i wish games would stop including generic shit like m4s and aks 
i fucking hate how every bloody game no matter how far to the future or past MUST have a fucking ak
kinda broke my own philosophy with the awxr6 but oh well it is based on an arx, which is just an italian m4 :/




why Do i have all these dev blog for big projects? self reflection
to see how far i has changed in both my goal and my philosophy over the course of a project 

and looking back, i see i was truly a retard
but at least my scopes are still some what feasible
my only enemy is Time and boredom 
and my own will i guess


Current Philosophy

The more unconventional looking the better
The more conventional it is the weirder the reload gets
Fast-ish Pace reload, each with its own style so you never feel the same thing (kinda failed)
Realism = Fail
EACH MUST BE UNIQUE, BE IT STATS OR VISUAL

List of failure:
APX-10
SeRv-45
HL-877
Adler-442
