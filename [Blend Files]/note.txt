the models have flipped normals(not the channel), inconsistence scale cuz i use different modelling technique and scalling size for them
some of them out right have different palette but im too lazy to keep everything consistence
might wanna rerig the guns if you wanna use it since, yknow inconsistence scalling and all

actually just dont touch any of this, 
this is mainly for me to organise shit

i manage to "discover" like about 3 different animate technique so if you see extra bones or wobbly graph, thats me and its super destructive
